rootscope
----------
angular.module('sample',[]).run($rootscope,function($rootscope))(){
	$rootscope.taxpercent = 30;
});


wherever angular encounter ng-app  $rootscope is created


Modifiying rootscope
---------
rootscope can be modified in any of the sibling but this is not a good practice 
to use rootscope to share data among child scope

rootscope can be initialized in any controller too
