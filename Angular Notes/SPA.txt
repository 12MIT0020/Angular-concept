SPA(single page application)
----

SPA is concept where rather than loading page from server through postback we create a single shell page or master page
and loads the webpages inside that master page.

SPA implemented using routing

Angular routing is a three step process (Below is a visual diagram for the same): -

    Step 1: - End user clicks on a hyperlink or button and generates action.
    Step 2: - This action is routed to the route provider.
    Step 3: - Router provider scans the URL and loads the view in the place holder defined by “ng-view” attribute.
	
	
Routing can be implemented through routing too by angular-UI
Angualr UI implements routing through states

myApp.config(function ($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {
    $stateProvider
        .state('Home', {
            url: '/HomePage',
            templateUrl: 'Home.htm'
        })
        .state('About', {
url: '/About',
            templateUrl: 'About.htm'
        })};
